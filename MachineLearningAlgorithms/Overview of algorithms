MScialgaeML.ipynb contains systems 1 and 2
  -System 1 predic predicts tertile of chloroplast gene expression using UTR sequence as an input
  -System 2 uses 3' UTR length and secondary structure minimum free energy to make the same prediction
 
Transferlearningsystem.ipynb contains system 3
  -This is trained using nuclear gene data, specifically 3' and 5' UTR sequence information
  -It uses this to then predict chloroplast gene expression in tertiles

The DNA processing is based on the work of krishnaik06, at https://github.com/krishnaik06/DNA-Sequencing-Classifier/
